Now, let’s go ahead and jump right into this so that we don’t waste too much of your time. It is recommended that you not be in an emotional state while reading this as it can be foreseen this turning into a shit flinging festival in the comments. So, if you’re emotionally invested in your stock right now, take however long you need to calm down so you’re able to look at this with a clear mind. Also, grab a beer or six beers and enjoy reading! 











I. Preface
Originally, it was not thought necessary to write a section like this however there seems to be misinformation circulating that needs to be addressed.
What is Shorting?
Shorting a stock is where you borrow a security that has been lent to you and sell the security in the hopes of buying it back later at a cheaper price. This borrowed security can be used in a multitude of fashions as a market maker. 
Can sell it back and forth between companies which would create a wash sale down.
Can create a sell wall that would have to be bought completely for the price to go beyond it.
Can use it to mitigate your own risk and drive the price back down by heavily shorting.
There are other methods but you get the idea.
However, the main concern is when you sell this stock to a person who is planning to hold it. Now, you have to go into the market and buy stock to meet the delivery of the one borrowed (If you are margin called or want to close your short position). In essence, when you short a stock, you are creating a share that should not exist or better put was not a part of the original total shares outstanding. 
What is Naked Shorting? 
Naked shorting is when you sell short while a borrow is not located. As a market maker, you can do this in the name and for the sake of liquidity.
Naked shorting can also be done by selling a call that is then exercised away when you do not possess the shares.

Under D - “Naked” short selling is not necessarily a violation of the federal securities laws or the Commission’s rules. Indeed, in certain circumstances, “naked” short selling contributes to market liquidity.

Is it possible to have more than 100% ownership of a company without any foul play? 
The answer is yes. The way this also happens can be explained in this scenario below: 
‘Company A’ has 1 million shares outstanding. ‘Institution B’ decides to buy ALL 1 million shares. ‘Institution C’ decides to borrow 200,000 shares from ‘Institution B’ to short the stock, however ‘Institution D’ ends up purchasing all these shorted stock. Now the amount of shares in circulation is 1,200,000 shares (20% more than the shares outstanding) and ‘Institution C’ must purchase back the 200,000 shares at a later date to CLOSE the short position. Furthermore, this can cause institutional ownership to be more than 100% in some cases, as both ‘Institution B’ and ‘Institution D’ own these shares in this example. (This doesn’t take away the fact many company's stocks are shorted in harmful ways that eventually drive the company to bankruptcy. The above example was to show that this can happen without foul play.)

II.	AMC Fundamentals
Partnership with Warner Brothers
It could be said this is a great opportunity for AMC because they’re able to have exclusive rights to movies when they’re released. The unfortunate thing is that there are multiple studios which will require more partnerships and for streaming services to be okay with this. Something that it does bring up as a question is what the partnership entails. What is AMC giving to WB in order to have exclusive rights for the 45 days? We don’t know what this is and would assume a higher percentage cut of movie profits, but it is currently not known. So, we’d say this is a potentially great thing for AMC investors.

We commend AMC for listening and creating an NFT to be delivered for a ticket and for share ownership. However, these things are the equivalent of Plastic McDonalds toys. Looking around online, if someone wanted to create an NFT to sell or distribute which looked similar to the one AMC made, it looks like the total time necessary would be ~15 minutes plus art time. So, this does not seem to be a task that is insurmountable by anyone. This also doesn’t seem like something you would need to hire specific people for like the entire NFT department GameStop has. Furthermore, the “I OWN AMC” NFT could have been claimed by anyone if they wanted it, which makes it almost worthless.

Popcorn GDP and what this would add to the company
So, we will make this one short and sweet. The total gross domestic product of popcorn (the edible kind) in the world is estimated to be ~5.55B by 2025. So, let’s say that it is 5.55B right now. Now, this is if AMC is able to distribute worldwide and every other manufacturer of popcorn (the edible kind) goes out of business such as Orville etc. This is also under the assumption that AMC doesn’t have to purchase any additional infrastructure to distribute worldwide along with the different varieties of popcorn requiring different infrastructure as well.
Just adding the 5.55 Billion to the stock equates to a total market share addition of $10.82 added per share. 
MATH: 5.55B divided by 513M. While this would be good for the stock, you may see why this would be a large task to try and handle.
Now, let’s say that it’s actually double 5.55B this could be due to the added infrastructure required or the partnerships. We’re giving AMC the benefit of the doubt and doubling the GDP of popcorn and adding it straight to AMC without any negative parts to this fundamentally. The $10.82 turns into $21.64 added per share.
Source 1 - Popcorn GDP source - https://www.wboc.com/story/43954333/global-popcorn
Source 2 - Further research on Amplify if you’re inclined - https://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/05/amplify-a-popcorn-company-with-a-11-billion-market-value.html
Amplify is a snack food brand that started off with a $1.1B market valuation.

Now, we had mentioned prior how AMC would have issues trying to capture the world's GDP of Popcorn  but let’s go into what all would be necessary for this:

First, the cost basis for actual popcorn per bag is less than $2.00 including electricity for microwaving and the purchase price of the bag itself. (Roughly per bag)
If they’re planning to do delivery of popcorn then it would require this amount per bag unless people are purchasing it as a luxury item. In which case it’s whatever at that point. We don’t know of the viability of this, but we do know that $2.00 would have to be beaten to have this popcorn as a consideration. This also doesn’t account for the 2 minutes and 30 seconds that would be required to make it by yourself vs however long for it to be delivered ready-made.
If they plan to have bagged popcorn, then this would require an actual plant like with what Orville has as their current popcorn is produced via a kettle method in theaters and not bagged.
Popcorn sold in grocery stores – This could be viable depending on price and I won’t discount it. However, a few places we know and have gone to offer popcorn for free without charging for the purchase just for store patronage. Again, this may be an expense because it will require: an individual manning the popcorn station, a distribution or piggybacking distribution on grocery stores, and stations that sell popcorn itself which includes but is not limited to the kettle, cash register, and employee wage.
On top of all of what is mentioned, having the popcorn delivered directly to people would no longer get people into the theaters spending more for sweets, sodas, or the tickets. So, they’re just ordering the popcorn to stay inside and watch Netflix or other streaming services.


Moving into food distribution:
We won’t discount this as it was mentioned to me in passing but we believe it holds weight.
This would put more money into AMC’s pockets via utilization of DoorDash
Not a large cost increase other than the additional reserves of food that would possibly need to be stored.
The question is will people, other than AMC Investors, be purchasing food from AMC rather than ordering from Chilis, Applebees, LongHorn, Texas Roadhouse, IHop, Dennys, Chipotle, Olive Garden, Carabbas, Dairy Queen, Five guys, or any of the other chain eateries that offer delivery through applications and specialize in food?
We won’t discount that this is a viable revenue stream without as much additional overhead, however, there are drawbacks such as the local competition and food storage.

AMC currently has liquidity availability of more than $1.8 billion (including cash and undrawn revolver lines)

AMC is in the process of acquiring more theaters to add to their already large amount of theaters. This has pros and cons
Not a change or revamp of their old business model so still relying on existing revenue stream
Creation of new locations to expand brand recognition.
If another plague hits they’re back where they started as they haven’t revamped into something new.
Becoming the largest movie chain could mean potential deals with movie producers which could benefit the shareholders through a price increase. This could be with movie studio partnerships or something else but being the largest theater chain does have some weight that can be swung around.


Current Debt of AMC is roughly around 5.45 Billion dollars. While this debt is currently deferred for roughly a year and a half this is still a large amount of cash due. Even at a rate of 3% per year that is $163,500,000 due every year and that would be an amazing interest rate if they managed to get it. Judging by Source 4 it looks as though their rough interest rate per year is roughly 7.72%. To figure this out I used:
(Q1 153M+Q2 89.5M+Q3 89.9M+Q4 89M)(This is not a correct or proper number and if it is found to be wrong then the percentage will change) Divided by total debt of 5.45Billion x 100 to get the percentage = 7.72% roughly per year on the debt or a total expenditure of $420,740,000 dollars every year.

“It's safe for AMC to start paying back some loans
On Sept. 30, AMC announced a repurchase of $35 million of its debt bearing a minimum 15% interest rate. The cost to repurchase the debt was $41.3 million, including principal and unpaid interest. As a result, AMC will save $5.25 million annually on interest expenses. That's undoubtedly good news for the battered movie theater chain, which has been devastated by the pandemic.
"The repurchase of some of our highest cost debt is one of the many steps that we are taking to optimally position AMC for the future," said Adam Aron, AMC's chairman and CEO.
Overall, management has skillfully navigated the coronavirus pandemic. The company was forced to shut its doors to moviegoers, which essentially brought its revenue to zero for several months. And because it was not feasible to reduce expenses to zero (you can't eliminate rent expense), the company was losing hundreds of millions of dollars each month. 
Raising cash became the most critical activity, and management did not disappoint. In the most recent quarter alone, the company raised $1.25 billion of new equity capital. As of June 30, AMC had $2 billion in liquidity on its balance sheet. And with nearly all of its movie theaters reopened and folks cautiously returning to watching films on the big screen, the worst-case scenario of running out of cash is all but eliminated for AMC. Therefore, it's safe for AMC to start using that money to pay back loans.

The next phase for AMC 
Paying back $35 million of its high-interest debt was a step in the right direction, but AMC still has a long way to go. As of June 30, the company had $5.5 billion on debt on its balance sheet.
That debt has cost the company $239.6 million in interest expenses in the first six months of 2021. To put that figure into context, overall revenue during the same time was $593 million. AMC's interest expense as a portion of revenue is still a heavy burden on the company. Thankfully, AMC also has $1.8 billion of cash on its balance sheet. If it can continue using the cash to pay off more of its highest-interest debt, it will go a long way in returning the company to operating profitably.
AMC is heading in the right direction in its recovery from the pandemic. Still, investors interested in buying the stock should wait until the company makes more progress in raising revenue and decreasing expenses.”
To highlight a particular point of the above:
That debt has cost the company $239.6 million in interest expenses in the first six months of 2021. To put that figure into context, overall revenue during the same time was $593 million.

We just think there was some important information that shouldn’t be ignored simply because it was written by fool and the points brought up by the journalist were good for discussion.)
Adam Aron has been quite active with his shareholders which can be shown by answering questions over the shareholders call. This can be seen as a positive thing because the shareholders are being heard. He has made several appearances to answer the news as well as speak with shareholders. Now, on the negative side, Adam Aron has also been flying around from theater to theater to do showings of movies rather than trying to figure out how to deal with the 5.4B debt situation or coming up with a strategy to meet this need for loan repayment. If Aron is planning to retire, though, like he has shown by selling most of his vested shares, then he needs to have someone that he can pass the business along to to see AMC survive.

NFL and UFC at 4% of their theaters. Through research it is believed to be around 950 theaters total and roughly 38 have the capacity to do sports. Math could be slightly off but feel free to check the sources. While this may be a new business venture, it is not known how well this will work. The reasons have been listed below.
Bringing the bar scene into a carpet floor and leather chair environment. Personal experiences lead this to be considered a bad idea. If you look at the interior of bars and where the UFC and Football games normally are there is a reason that furniture is near indestructible with the floor being made of tile or concrete. These surfaces are easy to clean in case of a mess. Now, we can hear you say, “well, I’m going for the experience that the theater will provide” ok cool we have more points below.
Pitchers of beer are $10 over what they are normally at a bar.
Non-easy clean surfaces would mean the cleaning crew is going to have to clean the floors well in case of an unexpected mess.
This is a viable venture if you live close by one of the aforementioned theaters; however, some have to travel an hour to get to a theater that has the capacity to play a game where as there are 4-5 bars near some writing this along with restaurants that have blow-up screens that play the game/UFC fight as well.
So, while this may not be a bad idea it is something that is unable to prop up the stock price.

Share ownership for AMC. This is the insider information according to the provided source however there are some that might not be considered as part of the board. So, since it appears as though ~959,843 shares (subject to change with more insider selling over time) are owned by the board, let’s look at what that chart looks like.
Note - Wanda Group has sold their stake in AMC and no longer maintains 10% ownership in the company. They still maintain a limited amount of shares but it is not where it was prior.

That sliver at the top is the amount the entire board of AMC owns in shares. To further expound upon this as a percentage:
959,863/513,330,000*100 = 0.18%
Additionally, it can be found that insiders have sold shares on the dates shown in the above pie charts as well as before then which means shares were sold to the general public as late as 12/09/2021.
Source 1 - https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1411579.htm

Now, this is a reply specifically to people that are saying that insider share ownership doesn’t matter and quoting DFV/KG/Roaring Kitty when saying this. If you recall there are also videos of DFV saying, “I looked at AMC. This is a terrible chart. It’s at support. They’re battling some shit right now. I don’t have any thoughts on AMC. They’re battling some risks with the pandemic. I don’t know how they’re going to fair but assuming we overcome this people will still want to see movies in theaters. Investment thesis is a lot more than (when investing) this product will be around in the future. No opinion.”
Second video: “I looked at amc on the last tube. No strong opinion on AMC. Chart doesn’t look great. No strong opinion. I’m a fundamentals investor. This isn’t to say it’s bad or that it has no future. I just don’t care or have an opinion. Could be something happening but can’t tell in chart.”

AMC NFTs.
AMC have released two NFT drops so far. This was the “I own AMC” NFT as a gesture to the shareholders and the Sony partnership that included 100+ Spider-Man NFT’s. Although these were both thoughtful ideas, they were given out for free and so AMC received no revenue as a result of the NFT sales. They could further explore this idea in the future and consider charging $ for unique and rare NFT’s for movies as new movies enter the theaters.

CEO Adam Aron announced AMC will now sell vegan nuggets at the movie theaters. The main point about this is the fact he stated “we’ve been working for years to be able to make this announcement.” Although, it takes a long time to create a food product to be released into stores nation-wide, it is alarming that they spent years working on a product that may prove to bring in low amounts of revenue per year. Management should consider working on other streams of revenues that can help turn the company around and thrive.

Mainstream media attention:
Contrary to belief, AMC has had lots of Mainstream media attention throughout 2021. The $AMC ticker symbol was looked at 195million times in 2021 on Yahoo Finance, 30 million more times than that of ANY other ticker symbol. 
Source 1 - https://twitter.com/CEOAdam/status/1476065261098872834?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet

This can be greatly attributed to being a retail sentiment stock with many influencers and mainstream media attention figures treating the stock as being a “forefront to defeating Wall Street”. This has especially been the case with CNBC hosts such as Charles Payne, Melissa Lee, and even Jim Cramer showing their support for the stock. This included a 49 minute video that CNBC released on Youtube titled “How the AMC Apes Cracked Wall Street” in which Melissa Lee interviews many AMC figures such as Adam Aron, Trey’s Trades, and Matt Kohrs.

It is evident that AMC has peaked in MSM attention and with the fact that “AMC Stock” was google searched more times than “Stimulus Check”, this may have been a driving factor which resulted in the stock running over 3000% (from yearly lows to yearly highs). This reinforces the fact that AMC is reliant on people speaking about the stock, similar to sentiment of DOGE coin or SHIBA INU coin. This leaves the question, if AMC is solely reliant on hype, what happens if a new shiny distraction is presented by mainstream media(MSM)? AMC investors may find that if a new crypto or stock is pumped by MSM, many may flock towards the new security as AMC is no longer a fundamentals/turnaround play (as mentioned in the report, the MAXIMUM market cap of movie theater industry + popcorn industry is ~21.104B, which reinforces AMC is no longer the fundamentals play it once was in 2020).
Source 7 - https://www.marketwatch.com/story/googles-2021-year-in-search-amc-and-gme-stocks-dogecoin-stimulus-checks-and-shortages-dominated-queries-11638950486

To end off this AMC fundamentals section, I would like to reiterate that if AMC controlled the entire movie theater industry, as well as the popcorn industry, this would leave a MAXIMUM market cap of ~ $21.104B (2021 figs). With the current market cap sitting at ~$7.7B this suggests that AMC owns/controls a large portion of both industries which is not the case as mentioned above. Furthermore, even if AMC somehow took over and COMPLETELY controlled both the industries, this only leaves 300% growth in the stock price from current levels (currently at $15). It is recommended that the CEO and management team explore new revenue streams. It is evident with the ~ $5.5 Billion debt that the company is struggling to remain profitable, partially due to hundreds of millions of dollars spent just on the debt interests. This is harming the progression of the company and a long term solution will be required to solve this. This is especially the case in the current environment where COVID is still going to be a problem in 2022. If management is unable to find new revenue streams, AMC shareholders may find the stock price will remain stagnant over the coming years. Also, this may result in further dilution of stock as it is the easiest way out of bleeding debt. 
III. GME Fundamentals:
GameStop is in the process of hiring people from Amazon, Chewy, Apple, Arteza, Zulily, Microsoft, Google, and other places to the tune of 350+ execs now.
Saying 350 execs doesn’t really have as much impact. So, the list showing them from GMEDD (on Twitter) has been added to showcase how many people have been added.

Note about above source – this is a one drive link so I would recommend not logging in via a browser with your google chrome logged in already. Should be able to be used in private browsing or another method.
This is just to give you an idea of who has been hired by GameStop and to show what GameStop is doing to try and turn around the company. Literally 5 pages of hires just as names, where they’re from, and when they’re hired. The fact top level management from some of the greatest companies in the world are leaving their jobs to work at GameStop is bullish and suggests Ryan Cohen (and the team) has a great roadmap ahead. 
Matt Finestone from Loopring has this to say in regards to leaving Loopring for a different opportunity. He is now the head of blockchain at Gamestop.
 “So what’s next? I am not leaving Loopring because I am tired of it, or because I am not interested in its future. I think you may see from my sappy message above, that is not the case. The fact is, an opportunity has presented itself that I am extremely excited about, and I feel I simply must take. I view it as a once-in-a-lifetime, perfect-timing, far-reaching opportunity/challenge that I need to pursue for its own sake, and for my personal development. I cannot give more information at the moment, but I will be sure to do so when the time is right — I hope on the order of a few months.

GameStop is in the process of doing something with NFTs and we don’t know what. This could be an NFT marketplace, a blockchain-style market, and/or an NFT dividend. However, through the GameStop Careers website, it seems they are hiring people with crypto, Ethereum, and Ethereum layer 2 knowledge/experience for an “NFT Platform”. As a side point, it is possible (most likely) that GameStop is entering the Metaverse and all things Web3 Related. In addition to this, there have been people that have worked with GameStop as Contractors for specific jobs to our knowledge such as (Twitter Handle) Foobar. Furthermore, Grayscale Investments in association with Bank of America has stated that they believe the Metaverse to be a $1 trillion opportunity. If GameStop is able to become a notable player in the Metaverse, this can present new revenue streams. 
If you want to dig further, we would recommend looking up predicted valuations for the metaverse and endless possibilities that would come out of Web3 gaming + NFTs (e.g. selling digital collectibles similar to Funko Pops, trading skins on games such as Fortnite, play to earn, etc).

In case you haven’t seen it, GameStop has teased an NFT marketplace. GameStop has recently called creators allowing people to send in submissions of their work to be featured on the NFT marketplace. This shows the marketplace is almost completed and may be released soon. 
Update - It seems they have received a lot of submissions within the short period that they called out for creators, so many in-fact that they have closed submissions for now. This is bullish in itself that it shows a lot of people want to be creators and are interested. If this NFT platform accommodates artists, musicians, and other creators, this could in itself become the best NFT platform on the web as of now.

GameStop seems to be remodeling some of their stores and exploring new revenue opportunities. We’ve posted some pictures that were recently retweeted by GameStop (originally posted in January 2020). There seems to be a lot of potential for this idea of rebranding some stores as an ESports venue where there are tournaments, finding new talent, and being the ultimate destination for all gamers.

Bought back shares. Originally Dr. Burry wrote to GameStop and urged them to buy shares back on the market. It took them a while but they ended up doing this.

GME's debt was paid off; the exception to this is GameStops 46.2M low interest loan from France (related to COVID). Stores were closed that were under performing as well. This is to the tune of 180-200 stores in 2019. Dec. 8 in a presentation to investors, it was stated that GameStop will close more than 1,000 stores by the end of its fiscal year in March. This comes after the company already closed over 783 stores over the previous two years.
It may need to be explained as to why this is good. To make it short, we would say this is a good thing because it shows that the business assets that aren’t generating money for the company are being cut, which means the amount of expenditure per fiscal year is being decreased.

This is just one individual so let’s look at the other insiders that are a part of GameStop.

As you can see by the pie chart above, the insiders have a vested interest in GameStop succeeding. What can also be seen on the chart is the dates on the left which show sales of the boards shares and the last sale from GameStop insiders was 06/24/2021.

Same day delivery for competition like Amazon. Say a computer part breaks, you're most likely up and running the same day.
Source – This one is hard to prove but there’s lots of posts throughout Twitter and Reddit about same day delivery being utilized. What is also possible is that they’re creating a shipping distribution network using their existing stores as hubs for distribution to local purchases. DoorDash or GameStop workers are then used to get the goods from the store to you. However, this may not be available to all yet because of the distribution and location of GameStop stores.

With GME soon releasing their own NFT marketplace, the new streams of revenue may suggest a higher valuation of the company. Opensea investors are valuing Opensea at ~$50k per active user. With 55M GME PowerUp members, this can exponentially increase the price valuation of the company if they are able to get members to become users of the NFT Marketplace. We would also like to add here that GameStop is hiring a team that requires knowledge of Layer 2 Ethereum which will give an edge over competitors (less gas fees, better security, more scalability, etc). 

GameStop have become more active on social media and @GameStopHelp on Twitter have been actively reaching out to frustrated customers. Furthermore, the social media team is very quick to reply to DM’s regarding all matters, which builds a trustful relationship between the customers and company. @GameStopEsports on Twitter was also made in May 2021 and may be something to keep an eye on. 

Ryan Cohen is not that talkative, nor are GameStop Executives when it comes to speaking with their investors. Now, during a prior earnings call it was stated that the company (GameStop) wanted GME investors to judge them not on their words but on their actions. It would be nice to have a communicative board but that would also, potentially, lead to ideas being stolen. If GameStop is working on something that is innovative, it seems better to keep this close to their chest.

“The gaming market alone was valued at USD 173.70 billion in 2021, and it is expected to reach a value of USD 314.40 billion by 2027, registering a CAGR of 9.64% over 2022-2027.”With the gaming market increasing at a high rate, this suggests that there is a lot of growth potential for GameStop as they expand into gaming and other niche sectors of the electronics market such as refurbished and used mobile phones ($60B+ market, expecting to be 140B+ by end of 2030).

As GameStop evolves into a technology first company, this may change the multiplier of the stock price. GameStop is currently trading at a ~ 1.2 P/S ratio which is very low. For reference, Coinbase is ~ 6.6 P/S, AMC is ~ 3.8 P/S, TSLA is ~ 20.46 P/S, SKLZ is ~ 4.6 P/S.

GameStop could be re-included into the S&P 500 as the company grows and reports positive earnings. GameStop was dropped from the S&P 500 in 2016 and was moved from the S&P 600 small-cap index to the S&P 400 midcap index in June 2021. 
The requirements to be part of the S&P 500: “To be eligible for S&P 500 index inclusion, a company should be a U.S. company, have a market capitalization of at least USD 11.8 billion, be highly liquid, have a public float of at least 10% of its shares outstanding, and its most recent quarter’s earnings and the sum of its trailing four consecutive quarters’ earnings must be positive.”
GameStop is currently trading at $97.91($7.5B market cap) so it is below the $11.8B thresholds which would require GameStop to trade above $154 (assuming the same amount of current shares outstanding). However, the main reason why GME has yet to be included in the S&P 500 is the last point regarding the “most recent quarter’s earnings and the sum of its trailing four consecutive quarters’ earnings must be positive”. As their financials and quarterly earnings improve, GameStop may see itself included in the S&P 500 in 2022/23.

GME DD is plenty abundant. There are many well written GME DD pieces by a variety of writers. In particular, we would like to recommend GMEDD.com who have written great DD showing how GME can naturally rise to a stock price of $1069 purely based on fundamentals. Furthermore, we would like to recommend https://twitter.com/GMEshortsqueeze who has covered a variety of topics regarding GME as well as AMC. Finally, we would like to recommend r/Superstonk, r/GMEJungle, r/GME, & r/DDintoGME and check out their plethora of fundamental analysis. GME DD may be lacking in this report, but once again, we urge you to check the websites, Reddit forums, and twitter users suggested, as we do not want to regurgitate their DD.

IV.	Fundamental Comparison:
Debt chart
So, the current debt of AMC is roughly $5.45Billion dollars. While this isn’t a terrible thing, this does lead to a few issues as far as issuing an NFT dividend as mentioned by Adam Aron on twitter as well as the amount of interest on the debt on a yearly basis. At 3% per year the interest on 5.4 billion dollars is $162,000,000 (yes that’s million). Now, in comparison GME only has $46.2 million in debt which is a low interest loan from France for a revolving credit line.


The side by side doesn’t really work for a comparison. So, here’s an overlay of the two to see how large the difference is between AMC and GME.

Before you ask, yes, the data point of $46.2 Million when related to $5.45 Billion is drastically different. 
Furthermore, it's important to add that AMC debt levels have only been increasing over time. This is even after heavy dilution over the years. This should raise major red flags for investors, especially if there is no clear turnaround plan. Since dilution is a possibility (most likely the case), this can effectively kill any chances of a true #MOASS. Adam Aron is also not required to get permission from shareholders if the share offering is under 20% as per the “NYSE 20% Rule”. With shares outstanding at 513.33M, Adam Aron is able to dilute ~102.66M shares. Although this may kill any chances of a future short squeeze, this will help get rid of AMC’s debt problem. This is a positive for anyone who is willing to pay money out of their own pockets to truly save AMC from bankruptcy, however a negative for anyone who is in the stock for a short squeeze or to make money in the short/medium term.
To expound upon this, the 20% rule seems as though this is only for private institutional sales as if they were to a hedge fund or another entity. These sales are done below market or above market value and if they exceed 20% of the votable shares then a vote must be done by current owners. A few key parts to this statement are private sales and below market or above market value. There is nothing stated that a sale can or cannot be made to anyone at the current market rate over the counter. (not through a lit exchange) Additionally, we could not find a source that stated whether or not a vote was necessary for secondary or tertiary public offerings at the market value. Source three leads us to believe this is the case; however, this is not a cited rule and should not be treated as such. Further research is required for this to be completely fleshed out.

With debt there are certain limitations. This includes distribution of a dividend.

New Executives
To our knowledge and as a quick summary Gamestop has acquired more than 350 individuals as part of their C-Suite Executives. AMC has added a new VP of Growth Strategies.

Share offering chart
Now, we’re doing a comparison of how many shares are out in existence. The more shares in existence the easier it is to cover the shorted stock. Additionally, the more shares in existence the more shorts can exist without being naked. 
As an example of this two stocks:
Stock A has 1000 shares
Stock B has 5000 Shares
With 10000 shares sold on stock A there are 8000 shares that are not located as a borrow (naked)
With 10000 shares sold on stock B there are 0 shares that are not located as a borrow (All have a borrow located)
*Note - This is also if a share is not reborrowed and sold short as in 1 share is being used to meet the borrow of multiple shorts*

This is an overlay of the two shares outstanding just to give an idea.

Something to note is during January AMC was mid-offering with selling their shares. The biggest thing is going to be the very end which is existing shares outstanding. This has been illustrated as a bar chart below. Again to reiterate, “The more shares in existence the easier it is to cover the shorted stock.” 


Share ownership percentages comparison
As you can see from the two side by side it is apparent that GME board members have a larger vested interest in GME succeeding.




Short report amount 226.42% vs 38.12% back in Jan/Feb
Now, we both know that these numbers could easily be falsified and fake but regardless, the REPORTED short interest on GME was 226%. This is just the number we were allowed to see. Whether on purpose or by accident. 
Now, what does that look like visually?

Cost per share vs market cap - With the purchase of one share you get more ownership of the company of GME. 0.0001% of GME is $15200 the same for AMC is $20520
Source - this is basic math using $200 for GME share price and $40 for AMC share price. Multiply the necessary stock price by shares outstanding and then multiply that number by 0.000001 (Add 2 zeros for percentage).


Influencers:
Now this may seem like an odd thing to talk about when writing up a thesis. However, this discussion may shed some light on the differences between the retail investors going long on each company.

GME: GameStop was thoroughly researched by an individual who was looking for a deep value play. This person was Keith Gill who went by the reddit user “Deep Fucking Value” or “Roaring Kitty” on YouTube. He currently has 549,000 subscribers on YouTube and 512,000 followers on Twitter. Roaring Kitty has documented several hours worth of live streams in which he takes a deep dive into the fundamentals of GameStop while brainstorming ideas that could make the bull case stronger. He has been transparent with his investing style which can be seen in his YouTube videos and has also been transparent with his GME position overtime. This was seen by his Reddit posts where he shows a final update in which he exercised ITM options as well as finally purchasing 50,000 more shares (at approximately $155) to give a final position of 200,000 GME shares (cost basis of $55.1774). Due to the fame, as well as lawsuits that started coming his way, he has remained relatively quiet on all social media platforms and only communicated in the forms of gifs and memes. He has not tried to convince anyone to purchase the stock, but rather taught them to make their own informed decision based on their investing style.
Source- https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/msblc3/gme_yolo_update_apr_16_2021_final_update
AMC: AMC also has its fair share of influencers. A few of the notable AMC influencers are Trey’s Trades (394,000 on YouTube, 240,000 on Twitter), Matt Kohrs (373,000 on YouTube, 160,000 on twitter), Roensch Capital (100,000 on YouTube, 55,000 on twitter), and The Masked Investor (57,000 on YouTube, 57,000 on twitter). Most of these influencers started to grow on YouTube during January 2021 when short squeeze candidates were being targeted. Although GME is often mentioned along with their AMC tweets/videos, it is implied that their main play is AMC. None of these influencers have shown their full position on any stock or have shown proof that they have not done swing trading along the way (which is against the AMC ethos for a short squeeze). It is also important to add that Treys Trades has mentioned several times that he has a “business relationship” with Adam Aron, CEO of AMC, reinforcing he may have incentives to push the stock. Although this may not seem like a big deal, it questions the narrative that he is trying to push onto his followers and brings up a lot of questions regarding ethics. Furthermore, these influencers have continued to push the narrative of a squeeze play to their followers without reinforcing the damage done by continuously diluting the company through insider sales and stock offerings which may potentially have killed any chances of a “MOASS”. Also, it’s important to add most of these Youtubers don’t like to bring up AMC fundamentals as they are well aware that the followers would not be invested if it was simply a regular fundamental play, which may very well be the case. Lastly, it’s clear that a lot of new “influencers” have decided to jump upon the “AMC movement” and convince others to do the same. This can be seen by the large numbers of OnlyFans, Youtube, and Twitch content creators jumping aboard the movement even though they may not have any idea how the deeper mechanics behind the stock market works. This sort of movement that solely relies on influencers and people convincing others to buy the stock is similar to that of Doge Coin or Shiba Inu, and may end very badly for those who have invested their life savings without doing any deep research.


Platforms: GME discussion is mainly held on reddit via r/SuperStonk, r/GMEJungle, and r/GME as many had to migrate out of r/WallStreetBets due to the moderators not allowing many GameStop related posts to go through. r/SuperStonk is the most active GME related subreddit with approximately 700,000 members. AMC is mostly discussed on Twitter and YouTube. 
Comparison: Redditors are more focused on GME. Twitter engagement shows AMC investors are louder and more active, although this may be due to Twitter being a more “Influencer” based platform. However, this may create a negative effect in the future. If influencers go bearish on the stock due to poor management decisions such as further dilution, this may impact future share prices simply due to retail sentiment, to which both are heavily reliant on. Furthermore, it is important to realize that AMC share float is significantly larger and subsequently, should naturally have a lot more investors (which has been discussed in more detail within this document).
To reiterate shares outstanding below is the shares outstanding bar chart:



To add to all of the above it seems as though there may be a conflict of interest when it comes to who is a part of twitter the company. 
Source 1 - https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/09/technology/twitter-silver-lake-investment.html
Article for the above source - 
SAN FRANCISCO — Twitter said on Monday that it had reached a deal with Elliott Management, the activist investor that called for ousting the social media company’s chief executive, Jack Dorsey.
The agreement will keep Mr. Dorsey atop Twitter — at least for now — at a crucial time for the social network. It also avoids a potentially costly fight with Elliott, the $40 billion hedge fund that has successfully shaken up many corporate boardrooms.
It also brings on board Silver Lake, one of Silicon Valley’s biggest investors in technology companies. Silver Lake agreed to invest $1 billion in Twitter, money that would help finance the buyback of $2 billion worth of stock.
As part of the agreement, both Egon Durban, Silver Lake’s co-chief executive, and Jesse Cohn, the Elliott executive who oversaw the Twitter campaign, will take seats on Twitter’s board. The board will search for a third independent director, with an emphasis on finding an expert in artificial intelligence and other technologies.
The announcement on Monday capped what briefly looked like a potential battle for the leadership of Twitter. Elliott had quietly amassed what is now a 4 percent stake in Twitter in recent weeks, becoming one of the company’s biggest investors.
Top among its complaints was Mr. Dorsey’s unusual role as the chief executive of two publicly traded companies: Twitter and Square, the financial services company he also co-founded. That split attention, the hedge fund argued, contributed to Twitter’s falling behind rivals in increasing its stock price and adding innovative new products.

As part of its pressure campaign, Elliott nominated four candidates for Twitter’s board on Feb. 21. It met later with the Twitter chairman, Omid Kordestani, and the company’s lead independent director, Patrick Pichette, to argue its case.
Mr. Kordestani and Mr. Pichette advocated a gentler approach, arguing that losing Mr. Dorsey would destabilize the company, and that Twitter was finally improving its momentum on product development and revenue.
Shortly after Elliott emerged as an activist, Silver Lake approached Twitter about a potential investment. The three worked in recent weeks to reach a compromise that allows Mr. Dorsey to remain chief executive.
“We are excited to partner with Twitter as an investor and a member of the board,” Mr. Durban said in a statement. “Jack is a visionary leader, and a critical force behind Twitter’s ongoing evolution and growth.”
But the settlement also lays the groundwork for eventually replacing Mr. Dorsey. Twitter agreed to create a new committee of five directors, including Mr. Durban and Mr. Cohn, that would study the company’s succession planning and leadership structure and recommend any changes by the end of the year.
Companies that Elliott has set its sights on have ended up replacing their chief executives after the hedge fund gained a board seat. EBay’s previous chief executive, Devin Wenig, resigned months after Mr. Cohn became a director of the e-commerce company, for example.
“We invested in Twitter because we see a significant opportunity for value creation at the company,” Mr. Cohn said in the statement announcing the settlement. “I am looking forward to working with Jack and the board to help contribute to realizing Twitter’s full potential.”
Elliott’s campaign was not the first leadership challenge that Mr. Dorsey had faced in his tenure at Twitter. In 2008, he was fired from the social media company he co-founded, then was brought back in 2015. A year later, Mr. Dorsey withstood an acquisition effort by Salesforce.
Twitter’s share price has not increased significantly since Mr. Dorsey’s return in 2015, when it was $36. At the close of trading on Monday, shares were $32.46, down 3 percent for the day.
Analysts said investors would welcome the news, although it was overshadowed by plunging markets driven by fears of the coronavirus spread. “The most important thing from an investor standpoint: Silver Lake is making a billion-dollar investment in Twitter at a time when the market is in complete panic mode,” said Richard Greenfield, a partner at LightShed, a technology and media research firm.
Mr. Dorsey spoke about the company’s slow growth during a Morgan Stanley conference on Friday. “Five years ago, we had to do a really hard reset of this company, and that takes some time to actually build from,” he said.
The company has also undergone frequent executive turnover. In 2018, Twitter’s chief operating officer, Anthony Noto, resigned to become the chief executive of SoFi, a finance start-up. Since then, Twitter has been without a chief operating officer. Mr. Dorsey has focused primarily on engineering and product development, preferring to leave operations to his deputies.
“Twitter seems remarkably similar as it did in 2015,” said Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at the New York University Stern School of Business and a Twitter investor who called for Mr. Dorsey to step down last year. “The question is: Does this company, at this moment, warrant a full-time C.E.O. who has an office out of headquarters? The answer, I think, is yes.”
Some investors see Mr. Dorsey as an absentee executive who looks after Twitter as a hobby. He exacerbated their worries when he announced last year that he would move to Africa for three to six months in 2020. Some Twitter employees, who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly, defended Mr. Dorsey, saying he is engaged and meets three times a week with Twitter’s executive team.
On Friday, Mr. Dorsey backpedaled on his travel plans during the Morgan Stanley conference, saying he may put off the trip because of the spread of the coronavirus.
“Everything happening in the world, particularly with coronavirus, I have to reconsider what’s going on and what that means for me and for our company,” he said.
Mr. Dorsey defended his decision to lead two companies at once. “I have enough flexibility in my schedule to focus on the most important things, and I have a good sense of what is critical in both companies,” he said. “I have amazing teams working. For the first time in our history at Twitter, it feels like we have so much focus that we can ignore a bunch of the noise.”
What does this have to do with AMC?
Well a few things worth reading are -

Again to reiterate as mentioned before when it comes to things linked on reddit, this is not our research and if you want to delve into this, feel free.

Furthermore, as mentioned in the CNBC Video “How the AMC Apes Cracked Wall Street”, Trey Trades has mentioned that he “made $1M dollars on call options profit. This came from the move from $10 to $70.” Similarly, Matt Kohrs mentioned in the same video “I am definitely more of an active trader. I have thousands of AMC shares right now. I started off with $30,000 with AMC, that ran all the way up to $600,000 and right now it’s in the realm of $150,000-$200,000”. These two influencers have made a statement that they have profited off call options and have taken an interesting route of collecting the profits in cash rather than exercising the call options to receive shares.
This is quite interesting as it suggests their conviction in the play may not be as certain as their followers think. If they believed the stock could be worth more than $72.62 (52 week high), they could have shown that in their actions by exercising the calls, which may have given better sentiment to others watching from the sidelines. This is very different from the approach Roaring Kitty took, where all of his call option profits were spent on buying more shares of GME. Furthermore, this can be shown by the fact that he not only exercised call options but further purchased 50,000 shares of GME at $154.69 roughly.

This reinforces the fact RK has conviction in the play as he went from $53,000 to a peak of $46M without selling a single share meanwhile exercising all options along the way.

Insider transactions. 
The insider transactions for AMC and GME are very interesting. 
Starting with GME insider buy/sells: 

Source 1 - http://openinsider.com/screener?s=GME&o=&pl=&ph=&ll=&lh=&fd=730&fdr=&td=0&tdr=&fdlyl=&fdlyh=&daysago=&xp=1&xs=1&vl=&vh=&ocl=&och=&sic1=-1&sicl=100&sich=9999&grp=0&nfl=&nfh=&nil=&nih=&nol=&noh=&v2l=&v2h=&oc2l=&oc2h=&sortcol=0&cnt=100&page=1
There hasn't been much activity within the last two years of GameStop insider transactions. The most notable would be Ryan Cohen buying 9,001,000 shares of GME with his own money. Also side note: Ryan Cohen definitely bought over 9million as a reference to the Dragon Ball Z meme.
(It's over 9000!!!!) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiMHTK15Pik&ab_channel=chowderrockz ) 
After Ryan Cohens buy-in, he decided to let go of a lot of GameStop management as he most likely felt like they weren’t doing a good job and a liability to the company. Most of the insider sales in January were a result of this and to the most part, are small transactions. James Kurt Wolf (of Hestia Capital) was forced to sell shares as his fund had to re-balance their positions as GME was too heavily weighted, and had to let go of 810,000 shares at an average of $21.22. Since 15th January 2021, there has only been ONE insider sale which occurred on 23rd June 2021 and was only 1900 shares. It’s safe to assume the GME insiders have been diamond handing their shares as there are barely any insider sales. The fact that Ryan Cohen has not sold a single share is all the more bullish as well. 

AMC insider buy/sells:

As you can see, AMC has a lot more insider transactions going on than GME. And, not a single transaction over the last 2 years is an insider buying, all insider sales. The most notable transactions would be Silver Lake Group (this is the same silver lake group that was mentioned on page 58-61) selling 33,317,145 shares at an average of $16.05 on the (reported date) 27th January 2021 and going from one of the largest investors of AMC to holding 0 shares. Shortly after this, Wanda Group sold 15,648,494 shares at an average of $14.11 on the (reported date) 1st February 2021. Just these two funds alone sold 50 MILLION shares between the two.
Another notable transaction is the sales of CEO Adam Aron who sold 1.25M shares in 3 lots: 625,000 shares at $40.53 on the 9th November 2021, 312,500 shares at $30.87 on the 7th December 2021, and 312,500 shares at $22.85 on the 11th January 2022. He currently holds only 205,086 shares although will be vested in more shares in the future. CEO Adam Aron suggested this was a planned sale for “estate planning” however, this simply feels like a terrible excuse to try to make shareholders feel okay with what has happened. It’s the equivalent of someone saying they're going to push you and then do it, does them saying it make it any less wrong? Furthermore, his tweet which said “I STILL OWN OR PLAN TO VEST IN 2,302,760 AMC SHARES” is slightly misleading considering he only holds ~205,086 shares at the moment and he has no choice BUT to wait until he can receive the shares.
Another notable transaction is that the CMO of AMC, Stephen Colanero, currently owns 0 shares of the stock as shown by the transaction on the 14th January 2022. The CAO, Chrix Cox, only owns 991 shares as of 14th January 2022. Feel free to observe other insider holdings through the screenshots above taken from OpenInsider.

AMC vs GME Executives TOTAL Compensation (Data from 2020) 
Starting with AMC: 

Source: https://www1.salary.com/AMC-ENTERTAINMENT-HOLDINGS-Executive-Salaries.html
Next up is GME: 


Source: https://www.salary.com/tools/executive-compensation-calculator/gamestop-corp-executive-salaries

Comparison (2020 data): AMC CEO Adam Aron received $20,926,785 in total compensation of which $6,106,491 was in cash, $14,798,988 in equity, and $21,306 other. GME (ex)CEO George Sherman received $7,174,244 in total compensation of which $1,004,808 was in cash, $6,120,184 in equity, and $49,252 other. CEO pay ratio for AMC was ~ 3803:1, while the GME CEO pay ratio was ~ 650:1. 
Note: This isn’t very  important, but it's good to know how much the executives are receiving.










V. Squeeze Metrics:
Division of buying pressure
For these examples the ownership and amount of shares owned are completely made up and are used to illustrate points. The ownership amounts are not to be used out of this context.
Simple example:
We have 150 people in retail that are wanting a short squeeze that go and buy stock XXX and we have 150 in retail that are wanting a short squeeze that go and buy stock YYY. All of these people put in the same amount of money for simplicity's sake, both of these stocks have the same float amount etc. 
150 people buy 1 share of company XXX which means 150 shares have been sold. 100 shares are only supposed to exist though which means 50 shares need to be bought back. 150 people also buy 1 share of company YYY which means 150 shares have been sold when 100 shares are only supposed to exist. This also means that 50 shares need to be bought back.
Now, instead, retail goes in and buys just one of the stocks either xxx or yyy. So, 300 shares have been sold to retail. During a margin call or to close their short position it is now required to close 200 of these short positions rather than just the 50 and 50.

Complex example:
For this example we will be making it slightly more complex but using simple examples still. There is no factual information and these numbers are not true. 
We have 10M retail investors and they have enough to purchase 60 shares of GME each (this could also just be their share average but the number 60 remains the same). This leads to a total of 600M shares being sold to retail. Now, during a margin call you can see how it’s going to be hard to get 600M shares back when only 76M are supposed to exist for GME. 

Now, we cut that in half and say 5M people purchase another stock. Doesn’t matter what it is but these are 5M people that are in the stock for “a reason” So, we now have 300M shares that are sold for GME. Which rocket do you, as a person, want to be on? Where does our strength lie? If we work together, which is what we have been trying to point out, then we will succeed.

Complex Example 2:
For this example we will use exact float ownership of two different stocks including the short interest. Again, to reiterate these numbers are not true nor do we know the truth behind them.
Stock xxx has 50% float owned and 20% short interest which means retail owns 70% of the stock. Stock xxx institutional ownership and insider ownership equates to another 50% which leads to 120% ownership. So for 100M shares outstanding 120M shares exist.
Stock yyy has 80% float owned and 20% short interest which means retail owns 100% of the stock. Stock yyy institutional ownership and insider ownership equates to another 20% which leads to 120% ownership. So for 100M shares outstanding 120M shares exist.
As you can see this leads to total outstanding shares of both companies at 120M total. 

So, now, since both xxx and yyy are the same value we are going to combine the retail ownership into one stock rather than have retail be subdivided among two. 100m shares of stock yyy are sold and bought into xxx. (again this is used to illustrate a point and buying pressure does not change the value of stocks because we don’t want to make this example too complex) So, now with only 100M shares of stock xxx supposed to exist you can see how now ownership is sitting at 220M due to 70M originally owned by retail, 50M owned by insiders and institutions, and 100M new retail shares owned. This puts short interest around 120% and total shares outstanding to be at 220M. We can assume that because retail isn’t divided now the 220M will logically go higher in the event of a short squeeze.
What is a stag hunt?
This is going to be a direct quote as it illustrates game theory and why working together leads to a bigger reward.
In Rousseau's telling, two hunters must decide separately, and without the other knowing, whether to hunt a stag or a hare. However, both hunters know the only way to successfully hunt a stag is with the other's help. One hunter can catch a hare alone with less effort and less time, but it is worth far less than a stag and has much less meat. Rousseau therefore posits it would be much better for each hunter, acting individually, to give up total autonomy and minimal risk, which brings only the small reward of the hare. Instead, each hunter should separately choose the more ambitious and far more rewarding goal of getting the stag, thereby giving up some autonomy in exchange for the other hunter's cooperation and added might. Commentators have seen the situation as a useful analogy for many kinds of social cooperation, such as international agreements on climate change.[1]
The stag hunt differs from the prisoner's dilemma in that there are two pure-strategy Nash equilibria:[2] one where both players cooperate, and one where both players defect. In the Prisoner's Dilemma, in contrast, despite the fact that both players cooperating is Pareto efficient, the only pure Nash equilibrium is when both players choose to defect.
An example of the payoff matrix for the stag hunt is pictured in Figure 2.


Examples of a stag hunt:
The original stag hunt dilemma is as follows: a group of hunters have tracked a large stag, and found it to follow a certain path. If all the hunters work together, they can kill the stag and all eat. If they are discovered, or do not cooperate, the stag will flee, and all will go hungry.
The hunters hide and wait along a path. An hour goes by, with no sign of the stag. Two, three, four hours pass, with no trace. A day passes. The stag may not pass every day, but the hunters are reasonably certain that it will come. However, a hare is seen by all hunters moving along the path.
If a hunter leaps out and kills the hare, he will eat, but the trap laid for the stag will be wasted and the other hunters will starve. There is no certainty that the stag will arrive; the hare is present. The dilemma is that if one hunter waits, he risks one of his fellows killing the hare for himself, sacrificing everyone else. This makes the risk twofold; the risk that the stag does not appear, and the risk that another hunter takes the kill.
In addition to the example suggested by Rousseau, David Hume provides a series of examples that are stag hunts. One example addresses two individuals who must row a boat. If both choose to row they can successfully move the boat. However, if one doesn't, the other wastes his effort. Hume's second example involves two neighbors wishing to drain a meadow. If they both work to drain it they will be successful, but if either fails to do his part the meadow will not be drained.
Several animal behaviors have been described as stag hunts. One is the coordination of slime molds. In times of stress, individual unicellular protists will aggregate to form one large body. Here if they all act together they can successfully reproduce, but success depends on the cooperation of many individual protozoa. Another example is the hunting practices of orcas (known as carousel feeding). Orcas cooperatively corral large schools of fish to the surface and stun them by hitting them with their tails. Since this requires that the fish have no way to escape, it requires the cooperation of many orcas.

Author James Cambias describes a solution to the game as the basis for an extraterrestrial civilization in his 2014 science fiction book A Darkling Sea. Carol M. Rose argues that the stag hunt theory is useful in 'law and humanities' theory.[3] In international law, countries are the participants in a stag hunt.[4] They can, for example, work together to improve good corporate governance.[5] All countries need to work together to achieve this goal (and create a regulating level playing field for their corporate nationals).







Source (this is a great read and goes more in depth. Direct quote is italicized and included because of importance) - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stag_hunt

When it comes to a short squeeze, shares outstanding matter and 76M is a lot smaller than 513M shares. Example using shares outstanding rather than float. For all intents and purposes let’s say that the amount of shorts for GME and AMC are both the same at 1Billion shares outstanding. 
Again Shares outstanding chart for a visual comparison:

*Note - This is using shares outstanding for the purpose of an example for better more truthful math you would use the float which is a fluctuating number. GME - 30M-40M roughly AMC 440M roughly.*
So, how many times does 76million shares go into 1 Billion: 13 times.
How many times does 513 million shares go in to 1 Billion: 1.9 times
Now, what that means is that to reach infinity if you own AMC you’re unable to sell as many shares as you originally intended than if you hold GME. To reference these same numbers 1 billion for each we will then use 5 million holders each.
So, 5 million holders of GME at 1B shares equals 200 shares each.

The same is applicable for AMC at 1B shares 5 million holders equals 200 shares each. Now, for GME this could be seen as a ridiculous number because of how high in price GME is; however, just follow along with this thought process. It can be noted that the DRS numbers for GME does put an average of 150-170 shares sold so it’s not too far fetched. 
So, if GME is to go to infinity what that would mean is that when you go to sell if you own GME you are able to sell 184.8 shares which is 92% of the stock you own. Whereas with AMC if you own 200 shares and want this to go to infinity you are only able to sell 97.4 shares which is 48.7% of the stock you own. If you’re not following what that means is that all people have to hold on to their own 48.7% when it starts getting to ridiculous numbers and can’t sell everything. It can be shown in the GME subreddits people registering shares via DRS that they never plan to sell and some are just registering their entire portfolio. Some are stating that they don’t care about the money anymore and just want Wall Street to crumple.
Math:
1000000000 shares (synthetic)/5000000 people = 200 shares each
1000000000 shares (synthetic)-513000000 shares outstanding = 487000000 shares
487000000 synthetic shares that can be sold divided by 5000000 people equals 94.7 shares per person up for sale.
94.7/200 = 48.7%
Same math can be done for GME but the math should be correct. We won’t repost the same math but the final percentage is 92.4%



How long it has been shorted. Melvin Capital admitted that they were short on GME since 2014 and GME was on FTD list since Q2 2004. AMC IPO was DEC 2013
As a statistical note.
Because the GameStop IPO was in 2002, it is likely that there are shares in existence of accounts of people that are no longer alive. You also have 17 years of shorting for GME.

Melvin being short on GME since opening which was in 2014.
Direct quote: Specific to GameStop, we had a research-supported view well before the recent events. In fact, we had been short GameStop since Melvin’s inception six years earlier because we believed and still believe that its business model – selling new and used video games in physical stores – is being overtaken by digital downloads through the internet. And that trend only accelerated in 2020, when, because of the pandemic, people were downloading video games at home. As a result, the gaming industry had its best year ever. But GameStop had significant losses. (Page 2 Source 2)

So, as far as a catalyst and has been proven before GME, to my knowledge, has the capacity to release an NFT dividend via whatever they are working on with NFTs (please see GME fundamentals for proof of this). If you recall Marc Cohodes Twitter handle - @AlderLaneeggswas attempting to push AMC into releasing an NFT dividend; however, according to Adam Aron (tweet cited below) they would not be able to release a token on a 1 per share security basis as it would violate their debt covenant (as a reminder GME has a revolving credit line with France of less than 50 million). Additionally, the size of the debt makes this a sizable task in order to try and release an NFT dividend they would have to eliminate all debt that is against them releasing an NFT dividend which could be between a little of the debt and all 5+ billion dollars of the debt.

Mathematically it comes out to a more likely outcome - It is more likely that 500M shares exist for GME than 3B to 20B shares of AMC existing. Harkening back to what has been stated before about the initial IPO of GME of 2002 with Failures to Deliver (FTDs) existing from 2004 and AMC having their IPO in 2013 DEC. it is far more likely that there are persons that have passed away with GME in their accounts than AMC. Additionally, it is far more likely that there are 500M shares in existence for GME, which is a squeeze-able amount for GME, than the claims we have seen of AMC of 1.4 billion to 20 billion. You can do the math over time but figure however many trading days AMC was being purchased times the amount of people divided by how many shares you think were purchased in that time period.
Example: If you believe 5 million people bought amc over 3 months to the tune of 3 Billion shares then that would equate to:
3000000000 shares /5000000 people = 600 shares per person
3000000000 shares / (5(days)*4(weeks)*3(months)) = 50,000,000 shares purchased per day.
50M shares /5 million a day is 10 shares purchased per person per day
10 shares per person per day * $5 share price is at minimum a $50 expense per person per day
600 shares purchased at $5 each is a minimum of $3000.
Now, if you’ll remember there are also purchases of people being made from $5 to $12 to $72. Which means cost basis may vary but the higher the number the less likely the average person has a higher amount of shares.
As an additional note Adam Aron mentions “4 million investors with small positions on average”. If the free float is ~400m this means each retail investor holds 100 shares each. This sounds about right considering a small average would be under XXX shares. Interesting wording by Adam Aron as if the float is owned multiple times as some twitter users suggest, this would multiply the shares held on average (100 multiplied *how many times float is owned* – seems unrealistic considering AA’s wording.)

Now, it could be that Aron is not able to admit that there are however many shares there are; however, this is giving him the benefit of the doubt. For clarification for there to be 1B shares in existence this means  1B shares must be owned. A short is not sold into the ether but to another individual who believes the stock will go up. So, with 4 Million holders and 1 billion shares there would be roughly 250 shares each on average. 4Billion shares would be 1000 shares. 
*Note - This is removing ownership of hedge funds and market makers.*

Reported short interest - It is known that this number can be faked but even still when reported the short interest of GME was 226% compared to AMC at 40% at that time.

Selling shares directly to hedge funds for the hedge fund to profit. What it seems like from the below articles is that a hedge fund specifically bought 8.5 million shares in a deal with AMC and then sold these shares which caused the price to stagnate during a run up. This was buy pressure that was removed from the market because it was an OTC (over the counter) deal.

Investor relations has been contacted to try and clarify this via e-mail but there has been no response from them. We believe that the sources provided can allude to what has been said in this point. If necessary research can be done into the company the stock was sold to to see if the company sold the AMC stock after having bought it. To showcase that the stock was sold to the company.


The new NFT dividend company that AMC is pushing for is partially owned by Citadel through box.

NEWS and MSM coverage. Remember when the short and distort was being talked about in 2019-2018 for AMC? Why is it that AMC is seeing coverage with youtubers along with a movie now?

Funnily enough this news station is CNBC.
AMC is being compared to GME and being used as the pointer for why GME moves in three separate news cases. Why would mainstream media do this?

As the OP states as a TL;DR - 13F Data asserting that shorts flipped their position on amc to net long. This was mentioned once before in a prior section but is being mentioned here again to emphasize this point.
This is not something we have researched personally and we are only providing this for a comparison in this particular category. This is mentioned earlier but we believe it is worth mentioning again.
DRS'ing their shares - Some GME holders are in the process of registering the float. GameStop reported in their quarterly filing that as of October 31st 2021, 5.2M shares were directly registered through ComputerShare. When that happens, GME holders will have undeniable proof of the naked shorting on the company and at that point it's just waiting for a catalyst. Because of market maker privilege, the market maker has the possibility to naked short the stock in the name of liquidity. However, since GME has the possibility to give a non-fungible token per share because of the lack of debt, that would mean this would have to be delivered to the naked shorts as well. Since, an NFT does not have a cash equivalent all shorts must be bought back which means Boom. Although holders of both companies are accusing short hedge funds of doing the same illegal activities, it seems that only GME holders have tried to dig deep to uncover the truth for themselves. This was reinforced with GameStop adding the amount of shares DRS’ed in their quarterly reports. Interestingly enough, AMC holders have not been proactive to direct register their shares and many AMC influencers have been against this. It could also be because of the large float for AMC, it may be tough to get all shareholders to DRS. 
Additionally, Computershare at the behest of GameStop has opened a dedicated line for assistance with investors.

Note - This is not meant to be Pro- or Anti- DRS just bringing up a factual point.
Another factor that greatly impacts the potential of a short squeeze is the liquidity in the stock. This can be seen in the L2 data book which shows that on any given date, the GME bid-order spread is significantly wider than the AMC bid-order spread. GME has also been trading 2.7M average volume in the last 3 months VS AMC trading 43.1M average volume in the last 3 months. Even after considering the AMC float is ~6.7x larger than GME, this reinforces the fact that GME is a lot more illiquid and even trades like a penny stock on some days. This suggests that a large amount of buy pressure can quickly obliterate the L2 data book and cause GME to quickly gap up.
To put this in more simple terms, if no one is selling shares on the L2 order books for anything less than a ridiculous price then good luck trying to cover your shorts if you’re a short hedge fund for anything less than a ridiculous price.

Igniting a rocket. We hate to say it but as far as math goes and holding it would be best to have a minimum of 2 shares. Why do we say this? It’s because of how this lays out with how many holders there are. Just as an example because as you’ve seen from this post we love examples if there are 76M holders out there and each one owns 2 shares then no matter what this will reach infinity if everyone holds one. This may be outside some of your risk tolerances with GME fluctuating from $140-$250 for months on end. We can understand that. Luckily, there are people out there that are carrying more than just 2. This is the reason for the report: we are trying to get people to focus directly on one singular stock rather than dividing buying pressure between multiple stocks. With more people in one stock and more shares thrown to the infinity pool we'll both see greater heights and a larger squeeze with more shares needing to be bought back to cover.

VI. Potential Cons:
Now, we’re not above realizing that we could be wrong, but this document is to lay out points from fundamentals to MSM to squeeze metrics. NONE OF THIS IS FINANCIAL ADVICE.
Diversity – Some would say it is not good to have all your eggs in one basket and this point should be mentioned.
Both stocks do not have insane amounts of short interest as suggested by certain individuals, and may rely solely on fundamentals or external factors (NFT Dividend,etc)  to drive price action and true price discovery. 
VII. Quick Pro Summary
Lower debt (GME)
SEC extensively and exclusively covered GME and the SEC report clearly states that January 2021 events were not a short squeeze or gamma squeeze, only buying pressure as retail sentiment picked up. This was while 80% of trades were internalized (GME) 
Longer time spent shorting the company (GME)
Higher reported short interest of GME
Potentially self-catalyzing through inherent increase in value over time (GME)
Lower float (GME)
Gaming market has a substantially greater market cap than the popcorn industry + movie theater industry combined and is growing at a higher rate year over year. Also, lots of niche sectors for GameStop to tap into (GME)
GME is entering all things Web3 related and may become a key player in the Web3 Gaming, NFT (digital collectibles), NFT Marketplace, Metaverse space (GME)
Hiring C Suite Execs (GME)
More ownership and float locked per dollar (GME)
Less insider selling (GME)
More social media interaction on Twitter (AMC) **Some of these could be bots**
More communicative CEO (AMC) 
More MSM support such as Melissa Lee, Charles Payne, etc (AMC) 




VIII.	 Addressing posts done by AMC Investors:
You seem to care a lot about what I’m invested in?
The reason why we’re here is that people do research. Also, one person researched GME, decided it was a deep value play and then bought in. Additionally, we were careful when citing all sources with verifiable proof. So, this is more stating facts and concluding with logical arguments.

AMC is cheaper than GME.
No, it’s not. Mathematically your dollar goes far less when purchasing AMC rather than GME because of the number of shares outstanding.
Example:
$20,000 of AMC at $40 each gets you 500 shares which is 0.00009746588693957115% of the company.
$20,000 of GME at $200 each gets you 100 shares which is 0.00013157894736842105% of the company.
Alternately, you can look at market caps for this:
GME market cap = $15,200,000,000  (at $200 a share)     	
Math: $200x76,000,000 shares
AMC market cap = $20,520,000,000 (at $40 a share)
Math: $40x 513,000,000 shares
Besides, with the logic of buying something cheaper for the sake of being cheaper, then you end up having to buy twice.
Story time:
“The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.”
“Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.”
“But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.”
This was the Captain Samuel Vimes' ‘Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness.

“BUT… OBV on GME and AMC hasn’t changed?! This shows nobody is selling!” 
We’ve seen this misinformation being spread a lot, especially in the AMC Twitter community. So, we would like to debunk this while we’re here. 
Firstly, let's take a look at the OBV on GME and AMC. 
GME on left AMC on right.
(Screenshots of chart and OBV(On Balance Volume) from Tradingview) 
Now, let’s get an understanding of what OBV is and what it is used for. As defined by Investopedia: 
“On-balance volume (OBV) is a technical trading momentum indicator that uses volume flow to predict changes in stock price. Despite being plotted on a price chart and measured numerically, the actual individual quantitative value of OBV is not relevant. The indicator itself is cumulative, while the time interval remains fixed by a dedicated starting point, meaning the real number value of OBV arbitrarily depends on the start date. Instead, traders and analysts look at the nature of OBV movements over time; the slope of the OBV line carries all of the weight of analysis.”
The formula for OBV and calculating OBV (taken from Investopedia) have been posted below. Essentially, OBV is a running total of volume traded and is calculated by adding the daily volume to the OBV if the stock price closes higher than the price in the previous day, or subtracting the daily volume from the OBV if the stock price closes lower than the price in the previous day. 
Limitations of OBV as defined by Investopedia: 
“One limitation of OBV is that it is a leading indicator, meaning that it may produce predictions, but there is little it can say about what has actually happened in terms of the signals it produces. Because of this, it is prone to produce false signals.”
“Another note of caution in using the OBV is that a large spike in volume on a single day can throw off the indicator for quite a while.”
Discussion - As defined earlier, OBV is a technical indicator used to help make an informative trading decision about the momentum of a stock based on the trend of OBV. Furthermore, the quantitative value that you read on the side of the chart is almost meaningless. This is especially the case when a stock trades with large amounts of volume or experiences a short squeeze, as it throws the OBV off from then and needs a waiting period until the OBV has had time to settle down. This is because OBV is a cumulative indicator that simply tallies volume based on if the stock price increases or decreases. This essentially reinforces the idea that people claiming “OBV has only gone up and increased by X amount since Y date so therefore, we hold X amount of shares” have no idea what OBV is and what it is used for. 
Similarly, with that argument, AMC posters are suggesting that retail holds the same amount of shares in January 2022 as Dec 11 2020 (because the OBV value is approximately the same). This is obviously not the case, as we have suggested earlier, that the quantitative number itself is meaningless and it should only be used as an indicator of momentum. This was just said to reinforce the ignorance of certain individuals who are making these false claims. Finally, we would like to add that it is not a good investing strategy to have a thesis revolving around one technical indicator.

“AMC float was traded 50x! This means we definitely own 50x of the float and there’s billions of synthetic shares since nobody has sold!” 
We have heard this from some AMC investors and frankly, we think it's a silly and groundless argument. There are many stocks where their float is traded multiples of times for a variety of reasons (very liquid, good for swing trading, lots of volatility, etc). For reference, we would like to add that the SPY has ~702,780,150 outstanding shares and the 1 year volume on the SPY was 18,732,532,900. This means that the total of SPY shares outstanding were traded over 25x within the year. Does this mean that the SPY has ~18B synthetic shares? We think you can answer that for yourself.

Bro, I own xxx of GME and xxxx of AMC. I’m keeping my AMC because I’ve made so much more with it.
Hey, that’s great and the only reason we can see remaining in the AMC stock is for long-term capital gains tax but if you think it’s going to see the same heights that GME is going to see, you’re fooling yourself. It was talked about with the sections of dividing buying pressure and the examples of a squeeze earlier in this document. Furthermore, it is important to consider what happens if your investment keeps dropping in value and instead of choosing to realize gains, you hold until you’re back to break even/sell at a loss. At that point, you were better off selling and paying your taxes, rather than holding until a loss. 
GME is so expensive
Please see our prior point about AMC being cheaper (market cap).

What is the point of this? You’re just trying to cause division!
Incorrect. This is presented for you (the reader) to create an informed and educated decision. The contributors to this document are tired of influencers spreading misinformation about particular stocks. 

I’m putting pressure on Citadel because we’re fighting on multiple fronts!
This may have been true when AMC had 100M shares outstanding. We would recommend reading the mathematics behind the squeeze mentioned earlier on. In section V.
We would also like to add that it is possible that original shorts flipped to net long on AMC. 
Fighting battles on only one front (GME) would cause a breakthrough much sooner than splitting our buying power in half, especially if you consider how much sooner the float could be locked by DRSing. Exaggeration to illustrate this point: imagine fighting SHFs by buying ALL heavily shorted stocks. What is meant by the exaggeration is if retail is buying BB, GME, AMC, AAL, NAKD, and all other stocks that were stopped from being purchased in Jan 2021. You can see how this would divide retail buying pressure.
Below is a link that talks about this. This is not our DD nor our research (only used to bring this to the forefront).

I’m invested in AMC because I can buy more and it just won’t go as high.
Please see section V. and read the fundamentals of a squeeze as well as the previous point regarding market cap.

I’m not reading DD done by some random people.
That’s the point of these accounts. These accounts are anonymous so that information can be stated with citable sources without the need or influence from how many shares of xxx we own or yyy for that matter. If you’re being influenced and need someone who has a name out there telling you what to buy, then we apologize you will not get that from these accounts. These are citable sources with theories of our own which can be demonstrated mathematically and logically. If you’re needing to have someone that you can inevitably blame then, you will not find that here either. This is purely for information and if you choose to read it, your financial decisions are your own.

Wow, you must be Butthurt by AMC stock to put this document together.
No, not at all. We’re just here to do research and learn more about certain investment thesis. Hearing either side of a bull/bear case for stocks is healthy and gives room to create great debates. Everyone’s here to learn.

But fundamentals don’t matter during a squeeze!
While you’re correct that this is the case during a squeeze, fundamentals matter when it comes to catalyzing the squeeze itself. In essence, if the stock never reaches a value that requires a margin call on its own, you are waiting for other external factors. Because of AMC debt covenant, they are unable to release an NFT dividend which would force shorts to close.

Short it then!
If we were to open a short position, then this would be a biased article as then we would stand to gain from people selling AMC. 

Buying both stocks leads to the same reward.
First words we’d like to add here are the division of buying pressure.
We will discuss this more later but I’ll use a simple example now.
This example is made as simple as possible for illustrative purposes.
Story time example:
I have 450 total passengers that have booked a singular flight on an airplane. This plane, however, only has the capacity to hold 200 individuals on the flight. So, that means that 250 people will not be able to board the flight. 
Now, when I add another plane that holds 200 people you can see how 400 people are now able to ride the two planes in total. With these two planes only 25 per plane are able to be compensated. Because the individuals purchased separately and divided themselves among two different planes.


This isn’t a perfect example but it is being used to easily show that retail strength lies when they come together not with division.
As was pointed out when this example was explained it seems that with multiple planes(stocks) the passengers (retail) are easier to control.

They move together
This is a terrible reason to invest in something. If one of your core investment points is that if you’re hoping to see an increase in your stock due to GME running, then you can easily buy GME right now.
Furthermore, the similar price movement of GME, AMC, KOSS, BB, BBBY, the other “meme” stocks, has been looked into and can mainly be attributed to Variance Swaps/Stat arb/Algorithms/High frequency trading/etc. There is a lot of DD on r/Superstonk, r/DDintoGME, r/GME,etc on Reddit if you want to learn more about why lots of retail stocks (that were in similar ETFs) have similar price movements. 
You may even find two completely unrelated companies move similarly together. Once again, this may be attributed to the reason mentioned above. However, this does not go on forever. Stocks can eventually decouple from other stocks if shorts/long realize they were wrong in their thesis and change accordingly.

You're just creating FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) for AMC.
These are sourced and cited facts. If it creates FUD for you, maybe you should look at your investment more closely.

If I sell now I’ll…
This document is not trying to get you to sell. If you read through this whole document and have lost confidence in your investment, then maybe you should figure out if the investment you are in is the right one for you.

X. Afterword:
Now, could we be completely wrong?  Absolutely. We believe that this document with all of the factual and cited information is truthful (unless where otherwise noted). However, it is possible that a hedge fund that is short on AMC and only AMC gets liquidated first. If this is the case then it would be wise to actually have AMC shares but only in this instance. We say this because you could take the gains from AMC and put them directly into GME and increase your amount of GME shares more. It could also be that GME and AMC both don’t have any shorts at all and a squeeze will happen for neither stock but there are too many odd things in the workings of these stocks to say that that is the case.
At the end of the day, it is your money and you make your own financial decisions. We know where we will be putting our money on a long term play and a squeeze play.
